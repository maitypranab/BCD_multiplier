# BCD_multiplier
Design and Verification of N-bit BCD Multiplier using Double Dabble Method

#The multiplication of two unsigned N-bit numbers is carried out using the Shift and Add method.
#After completing the multiplication, the result is converted to its Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format using
the Double Dabble method and the outputs in both binary and BCD are displayed
